Commodity & Allocation Tracking System (CATS)
=============================================
The Commodity & Allocation Tracking System (CATS) project is Component 1 of the five components comprising the Food Management Improvement Project (FMIP). It is designed to link the different parts of the Disaster Risk Management & Food Security Sector (DRMFSS) supply chain so that commodities received from a particular donor can be tracked all the way to the beneficiary.

Project Aim
-----------
The aim of the CATS project is to improve the visibility of commodities as they move from the donor to the beneficiaries, through the DRMFSS supply chain. Improved visibility means improved management, which leads to improved reporting to the donors, thus addressing a key risk to DRMFSS – donors’ unwillingness to continue in the face of inadequate reporting.
